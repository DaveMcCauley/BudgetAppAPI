					<p>But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it,

						 even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them

						 no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a 
						 mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean

          <p>My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at 
					   Woking. He was a medical student working for an imminent 
						 examination, and he heard nothing of the arrival until Saturday 
						 morning.  The morning papers on Saturday contained, in addition 
						 to lengthy special articles on the planet Mars, on life in the 
						 planets, and so forth, a brief and vaguely worded telegram, all 
						 the more striking for its brevity.
					</p>
					<p>The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a 
						 number of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran.  
						 The telegram concluded with the words: "Formidable as they seem to
						 be, the Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have 
						 fallen, and, indeed, seem incapable of doing so.  Probably this 
						 is due to the relative strength of the earth's gravitational 
						 energy."  On that last text their leader-writer expanded very 
						 comfortingly.
