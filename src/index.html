          <p>My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking.
             He was a medical student working for an imminent examination,
             and he heard nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning.
             The morning papers on Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy
             special articles on the planet Mars, on life in the planets,
             and so forth, a brief and vaguely worded telegram, all the more
             striking for its brevity.
          </p>
          <p>The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a
             number of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran.  The
             telegram concluded with the words: "Formidable as they seem to be,
             the Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have
             fallen, and, indeed, seem incapable of doing so.  Probably this
             is due to the relative strength of the earth's gravitational
             energy."  On that last text their leader-writer expanded very
             comfortingly.

          <p>My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking.
             He was a medical student working for an imminent examination,
             and he heard nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning.
             The morning papers on Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy
             special articles on the planet Mars, on life in the planets,
             and so forth, a brief and vaguely worded telegram, all the more
             striking for its brevity.
          </p>
          <p>The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a
             number of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran.  The
             telegram concluded with the words: "Formidable as they seem to be,
             the Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have
             fallen, and, indeed, seem incapable of doing so.  Probably this
             is due to the relative strength of the earth's gravitational
             energy."  On that last text their leader-writer expanded very
             comfortingly.

          <p>But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it,
             but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the
             Persian host who murdered his own guests; sparing not the
             creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a savage tigress that
             tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes
             even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them
             there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No mercy,
             no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a
             mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean
             overruns the globe.
          </p>
          <p>Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures
             glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously
             hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the
             devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless
             tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks.
             Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all
             whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war
             since the world began.
